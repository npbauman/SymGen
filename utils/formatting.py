"""
Output formatting helper functions.

This module provides utilities for formatting output and progress indicators.
Currently contains placeholder functions that were planned for implementation
but are not required for the core functionality.

The module is designed to support:
1. Progress indicators for long-running operations
2. Consistent error message formatting
3. Output beautification and standardization

Example Usage:
    >>> format_progress_indicator()  # Currently placeholder
    >>> format_error_message()      # Currently placeholder

Functions:
    format_progress_indicator: Placeholder for progress indication (not implemented)
    format_error_message: Placeholder for error formatting (not implemented)

Note:
    This module contains placeholder functions that were planned but not implemented
    as the core functionality was achieved through other means.
